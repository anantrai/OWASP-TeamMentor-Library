However, this function only encodes &lt;&gt;"&amp; characters. This is not sufficient to protect against all possible attacks. For instance, the following ASP.NET code would be vulnerable. </P><PRE>&lt;img id='img&lt;&#37;=Server.HtmlEncode(Request.QueryString&#91;"userId"&#93;) &#37;&gt;'&nbsp;&nbsp; src='/image.gif' /&gt;</PRE><P>An attacker could inject client-side script here by setting <STRONG>userId </STRONG>to </P><PRE>' onload=alert('xss') alt='</PRE><P>The safest solution is to encode all non-alphanumeric characters. Only this type of whitelist solution will catch all possible XSS attacks, regardless of context.&nbsp; This&nbsp;requires more overhead in terms of processing time and size of the resulting HTML, but it is the safest encoding mechanism for all HTML contexts:</P><PRE>public static string HtmlEncode(string x)<BR>&#123;<BR>   if (x == null)<BR>   &#123;<BR>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;return x;<BR>   &#125;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return Regex.Replace(x, "&#91;&#94;a-zA-Z0-9&#93;&#43;", new MatchEvaluator(WebUtility.EncodeMatch));<BR>&#125;</PRE><P>This is also the approach that the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9a2b9c92-7ad9-496c-9a89-af08de2e5982&amp;displaylang=en">Microsoft Anti-Cross Site Scripting Library</A>&nbsp;takes.&nbsp; If you are using the Anti-Cross Site Scripting Library, you can use the <B>Microsoft.Security.ApplicationAntiXSSLibrary.HtmlEncode</B> method.&nbsp; Similarly, if you write URLs that might contain unsafe characters because they have been constructed from input data or data from a shared database, use <B>Microsoft.Security.ApplicationAntiXSSLibrary.UrlEncode</B> to make them safe.&nbsp; </P><P><B>Note</B> &nbsp; &nbsp; Make sure that you encode data at the last possible opportunity before the data is returned to the client.&nbsp; If you encode any earlier than this, you may not know the exact context that the data will be used in, and hence the format you need to encode into.&nbsp; Also, early encoding of some data can result in double encoding problems. </P><HR><P>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance. </P>
