Configure that folder in IIS to require SSL access. Those pages that support anonymous access can safely be accessed over HTTP connections.</P><H1>Why</H1><P>Using SSL across an entire site can incur a significant performance penalty. For sites that have pages which may be viewed without encryption or authentication, it will improve performance to separate out restricted from non-restricted pages. </P><H1>When</H1><P>This technique should be employed whenever an application has a mix of pages - some of which require authentication while others don't. </P><H1>How</H1><P>To avoid having to use SSL across your entire site, structure your Web site so that the secure pages that require authenticated access are placed in a subdirectory that is separate from the anonymously accessible pages.&nbsp; </P><P><B>To secure pages in a separate subfolder</B> <OL><LI><P>In Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), configure the secure folder to require SSL. This sets the <B>AccessSSL=true</B> attribute for the folder in the IIS Metabase. Requests for pages in the secured folders are successful only if HTTPS is used for the request URL. </P><LI><P>Use an &lt;<B>authorization</B>&gt; element to ensure that only authenticated users can access secure pages. Place this element beneath the closing &lt;<B>/system.web</B>&gt; tag, as shown here. <PRE>&lt;&#33;-- The secure folder is for authenticated and SSL access only. --&gt;<BR>&lt;location path="Secure" &gt;<BR>  &lt;system.web&gt;<BR>    &lt;authorization&gt;<BR>      &lt;deny users="?" /&gt;<BR>    &lt;/authorization&gt;<BR>  &lt;/system.web&gt;<BR>&lt;/location&gt;  </PRE><P>Additionally, the following configuration ensures that unauthenticated users are allowed to access pages in the application's root directory. Place this configuration in the main &lt;<B>system.web</B>&gt; element. <PRE>&lt;system.web&gt;<BR>  &lt;&#33;-- The virtual directory root folder contains general pages.<BR>       Unauthenticated users can view them and they do not need<BR>        to be secured with SSL. --&gt;<BR>  &lt;authorization&gt;<BR>    &lt;allow users="&#42;" /&gt;<BR>  &lt;/authorization&gt;<BR>&lt;/system.web&gt;  </PRE><P><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use this type of site structure, your application must not rely on the user's identity on the non-SSL pages. In the preceding configuration, no forms authentication ticket is sent for requests for non-SSL pages. As a result, the user is considered anonymous. This has implications for related features, such as personalization, that require the user name.<B>&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;</P></LI></OL><HR><P>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance. </P>
