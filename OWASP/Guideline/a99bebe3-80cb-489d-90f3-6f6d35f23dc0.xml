The strength of the algorithm is also important.&nbsp; Larger key sizes result in improved security, but performance suffers. Stronger encryption is most important for persisted data that is retained in data stores for prolonged periods of time.</P><H1>When</H1><P>If your application uses cryptography to provide security, examine what algorithm and key size it uses and the way it is used.</P><H1>How</H1><P>It is important to make sure you choose the right algorithm for the right job and to make sure you use a key size that provides a sufficient degree of security. Larger key sizes generally increase security. The following list summarizes the major algorithms together with the key sizes that each uses: <UL><LI>Data Encryption Standard (DES) 64-bit key (8 bytes) <LI>TripleDES 128-bit key or 192-bit key (16 or 24 bytes) <LI>Rijndael 128-256 bit keys (16-32 bytes) <LI>RSA 384-16,384 bit keys (48-2,048 bytes) </LI></UL><P>For large data encryption, use the TripleDES symmetric encryption algorithm (also&nbsp;called Triple Data Encryption Algorithm, TDEA) . For slower and stronger encryption of large data, use Rijndael,&nbsp;also known as Advanced Encryption Standard(AES). As per NIST&nbsp;recomendations, 192-256-bit AES&nbsp;keys are required for highly sensitive data.&nbsp;&nbsp;To encrypt data that is to be stored for short periods of time, you can consider using a faster but weaker algorithm such as DES. For digital signatures, use Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA) or Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). NIST guidelines suggest that 15360-bit RSA keys are equivalent&nbsp;to 256-bit symmetric keys in strength. For hashing, use the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)1.0. For keyed hashes, use the Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) SHA1.0.</P><H1>Additional Resources</H1><UL><LI>For more information see, "Chapter 4 - Design Guidelines for Secure Web Applications" at <A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa302420.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa302420.aspx</A></LI></UL><H1>&nbsp;</H1><HR><P>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance.</P>]]></content></guidanceItem>
