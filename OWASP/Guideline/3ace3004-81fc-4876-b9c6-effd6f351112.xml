With the secure property set, the cookie is sent by the browser only to a secure page that is requested using an HTTPS URL.</P><P>Set the secure property by using <B>requireSSL="true"</B> on the <B>&lt;forms&gt;</B> element as follows:</P><PRE>&lt;forms loginUrl="Secure\Login.aspx"<BR>       requireSSL="true" . . . /&gt;&nbsp;</PRE><LI><P><B>Encrypt the cookie and check its integrity. </B>Encrypt the cookie and check its integrity, even if you are using SSL. This prevents an attacker from viewing or modifying the cookie if he or she manages to steal it through a XSS exploit. In this event, the attacker can still use the cookie to gain access to your application. The best way to mitigate this risk is to implement the appropriate countermeasures to prevent XSS attacks (described under "Cross-Site Scripting" earlier in this chapter), and limit the cookie lifetime as described in the next recommendation.</P><P>To provide privacy and integrity for the cookie, set the <B>protection</B> attribute on the <B>&lt;forms&gt;</B> element as follows:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>&lt;forms protection="All"    Privacy and integrity&nbsp;</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>A secure &lt;<B>forms</B>&gt; element configuration is shown here:</P><PRE>&lt;forms loginUrl="Secure\Login.aspx"<BR>       protection="All"<BR>       requireSSL="true"<BR>       timeout="00:30:00" <BR>       slidingExpiration="true"<BR>       name="YourAppName"<BR>       path="/Secure" /&gt;</PRE></LI></OL><H1>Related Items</H1><UL><LI><DIV><A href="ruledisplay:f4b36918-6de8-40a6-96d3-de9e3499c89e">SSL is Used to Protect User Credentials and Authentication Cookies<BR></A></DIV></LI></UL><HR><P>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance. </P>
