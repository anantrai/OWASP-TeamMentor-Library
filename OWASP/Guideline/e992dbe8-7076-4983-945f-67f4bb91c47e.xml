You need to grant access to the following identities: <OL><LI><P><B>Your Web application identity.</B> If you are using a custom service account to run your ASP.NET application, you can grant the appropriate permissions to the IIS metabase and to the file system by running Aspnet_regiis.exe with the-<B>ga</B> switch. </P><LI><P><B>Your application's users.</B> ASP.NET file authorization performs access checks for file types mapped by IIS to the ASP.NET ISAPI extension (Aspnet_isapi.dll). If you are using Windows authentication, the authenticated user's Windows access token (which may be IUSR_MACHINE for anonymous users) is checked against the ACL attached to the requested ASP.NET file. If you are using forms authentication, access is checked against IUSR_MACHINE.</P></LI></OL><P>Use the following steps:</P><OL><LI><P><STRONG>Determine the users/roles that need to access the application's resources.</STRONG> Create a list of all roles in the application.&nbsp;The Web application's process&nbsp;identity and the application's users are the entities that&nbsp;require access to application resources. If&nbsp;a custom service account is being utilised to run&nbsp;the ASP.NET application be sure to list it as well, it will need the appropriate permissions to the IIS metabase and the file system.&nbsp;</P><LI><P><STRONG>Evaluate the level of access each user/role should have to use the application resources.</STRONG> It is important to assign the minimum privilege level for all entities that access resources.&nbsp; To do this create a table that contains roles on one axis and resources on another.&nbsp; Within the&nbsp;matrix cells describe the level of access each role will need for each resource (eg. Read Only, Read/Write, Full Access, etc.).&nbsp; This is commonly called a subject/object matrix:</P><P><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD></TD><TD><STRONG>Objects</STRONG></TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD><STRONG>Subjects</STRONG></TD><TD><STRONG>User Administration</STRONG></TD><TD><STRONG>Page Content</STRONG></TD></TR><TR><TD><STRONG>Admin</STRONG></TD><TD>Create, Delete, Modify</TD><TD></TD></TR><TR><TD><STRONG>Content Creator</STRONG></TD><TD></TD><TD>Create, Delete, Modify, Read</TD></TR><TR><TD><STRONG>Reader</STRONG></TD><TD></TD><TD>Read</TD></TR><TR><TD><STRONG>Anonymous</STRONG></TD><TD></TD><TD>Read</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P><LI><P><STRONG>Apply ACLs to enforce these restrictions.</STRONG> To assign ASP.NET permissions to the&nbsp;application's account, run the following command:</P><PRE>aspnet_regiis -ga MachineName\AccountName </PRE><P>Where MachineName is the name of your server or the domain name if you are using a domain account, and AccountName is the name of your custom account.
