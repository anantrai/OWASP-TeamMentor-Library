Encrypting network traffic addresses the threat posed by network eavesdropping. If the risk is deemed sufficiently small you may choose not to encrypt&nbsp;the traffic.</P><P>The type of encryption used also affects the types of threats that it addresses. For&nbsp;example, SSL is application-level encryption, whereas IPSec is transport layer encryption. As a result, SSL counters the threat of data tampering or information disclosure from another process on the same machine, particularly one running under a different account in addition to the network eavesdropping threat.</P><HR><P>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance.</P>]]></content></guidanceItem>
