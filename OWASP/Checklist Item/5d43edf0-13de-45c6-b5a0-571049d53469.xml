Your decision whether to install UrlScan should be based on your specific organizational requirements.

URLScan logs requests that contain these characters in the &#37;windir&#37;\system32\inetsrv\urlscan directory.</P><P>You configure URLScan using settings in the .ini file &#37;windir&#37;\system32\inetsrv\urlscan\urlscan.ini.</P><P>In addition to blocking malicious requests, you can use URLScan to defend your server against denial of service attacks before the requests reach ASP.NET. To do this, set limits in the <B>MaxAllowedContentLength</B>, <B>MaxUrl</B>, and <B>MaxQueryString</B> arguments in the URLScan.ini file.

If you have problems with URLScan, you can either remove it from IIS or you can analyze the problem by logging requests that are rejected.
