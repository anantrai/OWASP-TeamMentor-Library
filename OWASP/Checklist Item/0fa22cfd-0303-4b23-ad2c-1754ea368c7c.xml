Do not rely on client-side validation alone as it can be easily bypassed.</P></LI></OL><H1>How to Fix</H1><P>Check for known good data and constrain input by validating it for type, length, format, and range.&nbsp; For Web form applications that obtain input through server controls, use the ASP.NET validator controls, such as the RegularExpressionValidator, RangeValidator, and CustomValidator, to validate and constrain input.&nbsp; Check all numeric fields for type and range. If you are not using server controls, you can use regular expressions and the Regex class, and you can validate numeric ranges by converting the input value to an integer or double and then performing a range check.&nbsp; Validate your input against the least permissive expression possible that will accept all the input you expect for that field.&nbsp; If you know that the field will have certain internal structure, check for it.&nbsp; If your input has an internal checksum, like a credit card number, check that too. </P><P>Most Web applications accept input from various sources, including HTML controls, server controls, query strings, and cookies.&nbsp; Validate input from all of these sources to help prevent injection attacks.&nbsp; Use regular expressions to help validate input.&nbsp; The following example shows how to use the Regex class. </P><PRE>using System.Text.RegularExpressions ;<BR> // Instance method:Regex reg = new Regex(&#64;"&#94;&#91;a-zA-Z'.\s&#93;&#123;1,40&#125;&#36;");<BR>Response.Write(reg.IsMatch(Request.QueryString&#91;"Name"&#93;));<BR>// Static method:<BR>if (&#33;Regex.IsMatch(Request.QueryString&#91;"Name"&#93;,&#64;"&#94;&#91;a-zA-Z'.\s&#93;&#123;1,40&#125;&#36;"))<BR> &#123;<BR>   // Name does not match expression<BR>&#125;</PRE><P>If you cannot cache your regular expression for frequent use, you should use the static IsMatch method where possible for performance reasons, to avoid unnecessary object creation. </P><P>Remember that validating input does not remove the need to format output, parameterize queries, or otherwise handle user input carefully. </P><H1>Problem Example</H1><P>An ASP.NET application contains an order form for a web store which has several fields, specifically, a name, address, phone number, item number, and quantity.&nbsp; Each item is simply added to the database, with any typecasting handled by the database.&nbsp; While casting to the appropriate type helps a little, it happens too late to prevent SQL injection issues.&nbsp; Furthermore, there are no guarantees about the quality of the data. </P><SPAN></SPAN><H1>Solution Example</H1><P>An ASP.NET application contains an order for a web store.&nbsp; Each of the forms fields are validated, giving stronger guarantees about the data gathered.&nbsp; The phone number&nbsp;is validated as a string of ten digits (after stripping all non-numeric characters), or a variable number of digits beginning with the character '&#43;' if international numbers are allowed.&nbsp; </P><P>Validating a name, address, and item number can all be a bit more complicated.&nbsp; The first order of business is determining the legal character set for each case.&nbsp; For names, spaces, upper and lower case letters (including the accented forms for your current codepage), and possible numbers and periods are enough.&nbsp; Addresses need to add commas, hyphens, and number signs, at a minimum.&nbsp; Validating item numbers may be as simple as casting to an integer and checking that the result is in the right range, or it may mean a more complicated regular expression that checks for internal formatting in a string. </P><P>The last, optional step of data validation is to ensure that the data refers to a valid things.&nbsp; The data should be validated for format first, especially as further checks may require database queries.&nbsp; Item numbers are an obvious thing to check for existence in the DB, and this would normally happen as part of the stored procedure which creates a new order, but names, addresses, and phone numbers can be similarly checked, some times.&nbsp; For example, if the address field is broken up into components, state or province information, zip/post codes, and city names, at a minimum, can all be validated against existing lists.</P><P><SPAN></P></SPAN><H1>Related Items</H1><UL><LI><A href="ruledisplay:9e068515-3ba6-4ef3-aaf2-24937b61eb4f">Guideline: Validate All Input</A></LI></UL><HR><P>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance. </P>
