When checking file names, obtain the full name of the file by using the <B>System.IO.Path.GetFullPath</B> method. </P><LI><P><STRONG>Check File Paths. </STRONG>If you use <B>MapPath</B> to map a supplied virtual path to a physical path on the server, use the overloaded <B>Request.MapPath</B> method that accepts a <B>bool</B> parameter so that you can prevent cross-application mapping. The following code example shows this technique:</P></LI></OL><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>try<BR>&#123;<BR> string mappedPath = Request.MapPath( inputPath.Text,<BR>                                       Request.ApplicationPath, false);<BR>&#125;<BR>catch (HttpException)<BR>&#123;<BR> // Cross-application mapping attempted <BR>&#125;</PRE><P>The final <B>false</B> parameter prevents cross-application mapping. This means that a user cannot successfully supply a path that contains ".." to traverse outside of your application's virtual directory hierarchy. Any attempt to do this results in an exception of type <B>HttpException</B>. </P></BLOCKQUOTE><H1>Related Items</H1><UL><LI><DIV><A href="ruledisplay:581e8fff-7841-49ac-8bbe-d74e44aa9bd8">Checklist Item: All Input is Validated for Length, Range, Format, and Type</A></DIV></LI></UL><HR><P>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance. </P>
