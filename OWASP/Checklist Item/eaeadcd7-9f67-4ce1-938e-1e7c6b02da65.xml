For the anonymous account, create a group and add the anonymous account to it and then explicitly deny access to the group for key directories and files. Assigning permissions to a group allows you to more easily change the anonymous account or create additional anonymous accounts because you do not need to recreate the permissions. </P><BLOCKQUOTE><B>Note</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IISLockdown denies write access to content directories for the anonymous account by applying a deny write access control entry (ACE) for the Web Anonymous Users and Web Applications groups. It also adds a deny execute ACL on command-line tools.</BLOCKQUOTE><LI><B>Use separate accounts for separate applications</B>. <P>If your Web server hosts multiple applications, use a separate anonymous account for each application. Add the accounts to an anonymous Web users group, for example, the <B>Web Anonymous Users</B> group created by IISLockdown, and then configure NTFS permissions using this group. </P><P>For more information about using multiple anonymous accounts and hosting multiple applications, see Chapter 20, "<A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa302436.aspx">Hosting Multiple ASP.NET Applications</A>." </P></LI></UL><HR><P>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance.</P>]]></content></guidanceItem>
